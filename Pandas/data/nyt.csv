If the choice is between mining for bitcoin - which wastes hydroelectric power and takes up empty office space -- or mining for gold &amp
"<br/>To me, Bitcoin (et al) appears to be an expensive game a number of speculative people, many who want to hide their money, are playing. <br/><br/>The problem: it is only etherial math. Neat, but not worth anything if people get turned off the game by losing money. A matter of time, I believe, because it's too much like a Ponzi scheme."
"Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme backed by nothing and meaning nothing.  It is useful to criminal enterprises, terrorists and those bent on evading taxes. It is not a generally accepted form of currency and it will never be.  Yes, we are wasting huge amounts of economic potential on financial engineering instead of building infrastructure, devising new architectural methods, and rising to the challenges of global warming, rising seas, harsh storms and lack of potable water.  When the historians look back on us a thousand years hence (if there are historians a thousand years hence), they will see how foolish our moment in time was.  And, they will laugh and cry over our stupidity. "
"What does it cost in energy to dig up and refine an ounce of gold?  Are bitcoins any worse?  It's important to realize that they're not ""virtual dollars"", but rather ""virtual gold"", and subject to the same sort of lunacy as all precious metals.<br/>Thus, the main problem with a bitcoin is that its ""value"" tomorrow, let alone next week, is unknowable, while it's price is much more easily manipulated than is the price of gold or the value of a dollar.<br/>Cryptocurrencies have only two utilties: (1) you can buy goods or services on the other side of the world without having to pay extortionate fees to financial institutions, and (2) tax and law enforcement authorities can't detect or trace the transaction.   I'm pretty sure #2 is the biggie right now, although I'd be happy to take advantage of #1 if the medium could hold a consistent value from contract through purchase."
You forgot to mention stock buybacks. 
The unquestioned value of crypto currencies is that they provide an easy way for organized crime syndicates of all stripes to launder their ill gotten millions and billions while making suckers out of governments and the rest of us.
Bitcoin will change government profoundly.  With Bitcoin people have a choice if they want to pay taxes on income or transactions.  If people don't like the government they won't pay taxes.  This could cause dissolutions of unpopular governments.
"Of course currencies have always been virtual and value never actually is “in” the objects produced. The “waste of electricity” mining virtual currencies just puts the relations of production, consumption and waste that have always been there in that much starker relief. Haven’t we always been wasting electricity? Is producing billions of tons of plastic Happy Meal toys, styrofoam cups and cheap disposable-this or single-use-that really a more virtuous use of resources and labor? "
"Bitcoin is a scam and waste of electricity. So is most of the electricity used for cell-phones, Facebook, Snapchat, emails."
"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are difficult to explain, no less understand. That's the case for many things labeled ""virtual"", and it's therefore to be expected that many will criticize them as a waste of time.<br/><br/>But this tendency to rebel against something that seems inexplicable should be resisted. You don't need to look far for other examples of similar ""waste"". Around 2005 there was a worldwide ringtone market valued over 3 billion dollars per year. How much energy was used to produce, advertise, sell and distribute these sounds? How much energy is consumed by social media, whose profit comes from selling advertising? Would tying ads to Bitcoin make it more real, more justified?<br/><br/>Bitcoin may have a less than obvious purpose to many, but even if viewed as nothing more than online gambling (another energy user) it's right smack in the middle of a long list of very human, and increasingly virtual, endevors."
"I liked the wider take on us not doing real things, Bitcoin being one of them"
"Perhaps if we actually had laissez-faire capitalism in this country - and the government wasn't in charge of free enterprise-y things like power generation and money - BitCoin would be simply yet another form of currency that people would freely exchange for goods and services.<br/><br/>Since we don't have capitalism in this country - we have a ""mixed"" economy, with some dwindling capitalist freedoms and increasing socialist controls - then the shrill cheerleaders of statism (also known as fascists) will always complain about anything that isn't run by the government. Like BitCoin."
The mere existence of a currency that is created without an increase in productivity causes inflation
This article follows the same path as promoted by Noam Chomsky that the US is more concerned with virtual production than real.
Exorbitant bureaucracy is the biggest killer of productivity.
"Hmmm . . .<br/><br/>Cryptocurrency i.e. Bitcoins<br/><br/>Social Media  i.e. Facebook<br/><br/>The Winklevoss brothers<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg<br/><br/>Harvard's ""Best &amp; Brightest"" ?  <br/><br/>I urge Harvard University's incoming president to consider a heightened standard for undergraduate applicants :  the betterment of the planet and mankind."
"Producing one bitcoin depends on the region and price or electricity. It is in the range of $4k to $7k. Compare that to your annual electricity bill.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-one-chart-heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-bitcoin-in-your-state-2017-12-15"" title=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-one-chart-heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-bitcoin-in-your-state-2017-12-15"" target=""_blank"">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-one-chart-heres-how-much-it-costs-t...</a>"
"I wonder how much electricity is consumed by algorithm-driven stocks or forex trading, both of which are zero sum activities.<br/><br/>The economic crux of the matter was summed up by the famous economist, J.M.Keynes, who coined the term 'animal spirits' to describe the nature of our entrepreneurial activities.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the market will decide the economic utility of cryptocurrencies."
"The concern is the cost to produce, how many employed, etc. Making a movie employs hundreds of people (at least those made by the major companies). A similar amount spent on producing bitcoin employs almost no one but may use similar or more energy. And what is the bitcoin used for? Does it then just sit in the hopes that speculation drives up price - paper profits? A movie that employs hundreds then allows those hundreds to spend their money, thereby supporting even more industries. A key indicator for how effective a business is at stoking the economy is the multiplier of that business - that is how many times will a dollar spent on a given business be multiplied through the economy by its employees, its products leading to using other products or other labor etc. Bitcoin does none of that unless it is spent on something. And it appears most of the users are purely speculative hoarders. No one knows what the multiplier is, or if it is actually a divisor or a subtractor to the economy. "
When bitcoin is finally confined to the dustbin of history it shall be recorded that the only ones to make money out of it were the power companies.
"This article seems to fundamentally confuse economic activities that produce only virtual outputs with economic activities that don't generate much employment.  Those are perhaps correlated, perhaps because virtual outputs can frequently be copied with no additional labor involved, but they are not the same thing.  I'd argue the first is completely irrelevant from an economic standpoint except in how it correlates the latter; a video game is not intrinsically less valuable than a physical toy."
I'd like to know the cost (in mega watts and dollars) of producing 1 Bitcoin.
"In a time of climate crisis, I don't understand why a ""business"" that makes absolutely nothing useful but that will eventually have the carbon footprint of an Italy or a Germany or, eventually, the United States, is not outlawed."
"sounds like a lot of carping to me, and a very strange approach to economics to say the least.  What do you get from a movie?  Entertainment and distraction, but when you walk out do you have anything physical?  No, and yet there is a lot of money invested in creating film companies, movie theater, etc.  And so on with so many things produced by the economy.<br/><br/>How is spending real resources to produce a bitcoin any different?"
The basic concept of this article is bizarre.  Let the market decide - I don't think bitcoin mining poses any danger and has no need to be regulated. 
At least Levi jeans came out of the California gold rush to make it worthwhile for many people.  
"Yes, we absolutely have to destroy the earth in order to produce such fantastic products that make modern life possible.  The economy over the environment choice fallacy at it's most obvious."
"I often wonder how much productivity the US has lost since the 2016 presidential election, also. "
"what is ""mining"" bitcoin? Why does it take so much electricity? Am I the only reader who doesn't understand this (despite reading articles about it)?"
"I’m curious how different bitcoin mining is from any of the other financially lucrative but otherwise nonproductive computer driven financial services, like high speed trading.  Such activities generate few jobs and worse are not open to individuals or startups. At least bitcoin is something that small players can still enter. <br/><br/>I mostly agree with the criticisms of bitcoin mining but I wonder how many of its critics are just upset that the industry, such as it is, isn’t run by Wall Street. "
"I've participated in these types of exercises before, with members of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and the USAF. No matter how we played, the exercise always ended with a DPRK nuclear attack on US airbases in Guam or Japan."
"Maybe T should rush in first, as he fantasized re Florida.  Gulf of Tonkin anyone?<br/>Seriously, now that the Olympics are over the door is open for anything. "
The closer Mr. Mueller gets to Trump and his family the greater the risk of nuclear action.  Let's hope with all we have that our military commanders will ignore any instruction from Trump that is aggressive rather than reactive on the part of the United States.  We cannot let him start a nuclear war as a diversion from the forthcoming indictments.  
"The main reason why the Pentagon does not want war with North Korea is not because of its nuclear weapons (although they play the primary role in this confrontation), it is because of the conventional firepower, i.e. artillery and chemical weapons, they have pre-sighted at Seoul. The Seoul metropolitan population as of 2017 was 25.6 million, or the equivalent of the metropolitan populations of both New York City and Miami that same year. General Tilley is correct in his assessment claiming this conflict would be the most brutal war fought since WW2 due to the sheer size of the noncombatant population that lies less than 40 miles from the DMZ and has thousands of artillery pieces already aimed at them."
"Besides a war starting ""stray incident"" mentioned by Sec of Defense Mattis, we should be very worried about a ""manufactured incident"" especially given the propensity for provocation by the current Oval Office occupant. Gulf of Tonkin anyone?"
"I am struck by the number of military sources, though anonymous, in this story. I get the distinct impression that the U.S. military really, REALLY does not want to have to go through with this. And given the likely consequences and the fact that practically nobody voted for it, I'm right there with them."
"The prospect of yet another war fought in Asia by the United States teems with the chance of quagmire. The first Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf Wars and the continuing stalemate of Afghanistan, all concluded with indecisive results. The U.S. has been heavily vested in the future of Asia since the end of WWII, but it is time to exercise our influence through trade and diplomacy. No doubt that the DPRK is a serious threat to the eastern Asian region, but we must cannot instigate another war in which the end goal is undefined, once again. When will the U.S. learn to speak softly, and carry a big stick?"
"Ok, guys...if the joint chiefs or the civilian Pentagon planners and Trump want a war with North Korea, bring back the military draft and get ready for the massive push back Against WAR!<br/>Hey? You Pentagon civilian planners who create wars, what about Afghanistan and that endless war?You fools got us in there, and now you think that the American public will just greenligjt a major war with North Korea?<br/>Don't even think about another war, pal. In 2020, Trump will be voted out of office!"
"I can't help but think Trump is holding off on this until closer to the election. He thinks a military action will be his ace in the hole for a November victory. But, as usual, he fails to understand that the overwhelming majority of us would see this as a reckless catastrophe that will kill thousands of American soldiers, tens if not hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, and it will destabilize the world for years.<br/><br/>I honestly don't think military leaders would go through with it. They know and understand the recklessness. Trump doesn't, and wouldn't care if he did."
"What does North Korea really want? I am thinking that they have given up any hope of spreading their brand of communism around the world. They have the illegitimate, unelected Chinese dictatorship for that.<br/><br/>Probably they just want money. I would pay them in exchange for an agreement to give up their nukes and ICBMs, kind of like with their cohorts Iran but this time we would really mean it. <br/><br/>It's cheaper to pay them than fight wars and lose lives."
"The diplomacy guy resigned abruptly, if you don't know what that means you've been living in a cave. <br/><br/>Expect a strike, cruise missiles maybe, to take something out next time there is a provocation. Or expect a ship will sink mysteriously just after a ship to ship transfer in water too deep to understand why.  <br/><br/>A dog needs wagging.  "
"The defense of South Korea is the responsibility of the South Koreans, not of the US. South Korea outweighs North Korea in industrial might, technological know-how and military-aged citizens. The South Koreans are more than capable of matching North Korea in every form of deterrent military strength. It is time that we told them to do so, stating very clearly the time-table for own withdrawal from this foolish and totally unnecessary Big Daddy role. We are living in 2018, not 1948!"
"If the military wants to play at war, maybe it's time it included America in its plans. <br/><br/>Reinstitute the draft, so every man and woman over 18 has to register and be subject to being called up. Then maybe America will awaken from its Rip van Winkle-like sleep since 1976, and pay attention to where its sons and daughters are being sent, and why. <br/><br/>Is there a better way to control Congress and the Pentagon than an involved and informed citizenry? You know there isn't."
"American casualties can be minimized by the use of strategic nuclear weapons in North Korea.  While civilian casualties are regretable, it took 600,000 German civilian casualties to defeat Hitler.<br/><br/>The last war America won was because we used nuclear bombs.  People still live in Hiroshima and Nagasaki; countless American lives were saved and Japan was defeated with a peace that has lasted seventy years."
"Oh, everybody is like that. A good fair honest judge is a judge you agree with.A bad biased corrupt judge is a judge you don't agree with. That's all. In this case Trump is--somewhat unusually--acting like an ordinary human being. It won't continue."
"Trump will go down as the WORST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. I know when someone makes a statement like that they need supportive evidence to backup their opinion. My evidence appears on a daily, hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute, second-by-second news accounts about Trump and the swamp mates he brought with him. Historians will be in demand to offer ""we the people"" how Trump is destroying this once great nation."
"It is hard to imagine Trump as he is and has been as a man of principle.  I don't think he understands the meaning of the word, or for that matter, many words.<br/>While the principled among us do what they are tasked to do, Trump can only rail against the unfairness he sees when they do not agree with him.<br/>I'm sure he recalls Judge Curiel's name but maybe not the context in which it's familiar.  That is the way of Trump to put nothing before his own interests.  That is why he is not involved in governing or leading...he is only interested in being the top story off the day.<br/>It is sad to see the fortunes of this country land in such weak and disingenuous hands.  At least by now a majority of us know the game and the gamesmanship.<br/>Ego is everything and the only thing in Trump's world.  Fortunately the principled among us keep him in check and if he doesn't get the irony at times that is to be expected given his limitations."
"""None of this is remotely surprising anymore, but even so, Mr. Trump’s tweet about Judge Curiel’s border-wall decision revealed once again the depths of the president’s own self-interest and his utter lack of principles.""<br/><br/>Of interest &amp; possibly worthy of comment, but certainly not news..."
I'm not a doctor or a health professional but could this be a sign of being bipolar?<br/><br/>People are saying...
"While I recognize that the focus of this article is Donald Trump, it was the quotation by Chief Justice Roberts which most stirred me, because he is flat-out wrong. Brown v Board of Education was judge-made law, for which proponents of civil rights are profoundly grateful. Gideon v Wainwright guaranteed to all criminal defendants the right to an attorney, irrespective of any defendant's ability to pay for it. Miranda v Arizona created the eponymous Miranda warning. Loving v Virginia invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. Roe v Wade is likely one of the most famous examples of judicial policy-making, while one of the most little-known might be the 1984 (not 1784, but 1984!) New York case of People v Mario Liberta, which invalidated a statutory loophole exempting married men from prosecutions for raping or sodomizing their wives. And, lest the Chief Justice forget the importance of judge-made law, he might be reminded of his own role in both Citizens United v FEC (prohibiting limits on political campaign spending by corporations) and Obergefell v Hodges (which guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage in all 50 states); the Roberts Court has produced some of the biggest judge-made laws for both liberals and conservatives. So, any judge who is deciding whether to use his or her power to reverse a detestable action by the Trump Administration should be asssured that, in doing so, he or she would be part of a long and distinguished part of the American judicial system."
"What's the point of detailing all the bad things that Trump has done, once again?  We already know he's awful.  And sadly, we're used to it.  Trump, along with all his flaws, has been ""normalized.""  Listing all the awful things he's done, any one of which would have resulted in impeachment for Obama if he'd done the same, still results in a collective ""meh"" from other members of the ruling party.  I don't think Trump will ever be held to account for anything, since our expectations for him are already so low.  The only answer to the mess that is Trump is to vote Democratic on Election Day 2018."
"Judge Curiel did what a judge does or should do , interpret the law and render a judgement , If trump wins at all it's because he wears people out by being contrary and vituperative . He does not recognize what following the letter of the law means , simply because he doesn't care . Yes Mr. Trump , your job is very hard because you work for the people and the government agencies are not there to do your bidding."
"Of course, Trump supporters will likely not see this incisive op-ed piece or dismiss it as biased “fake news” because of its source (i.e., ""the failing NYT”).<br/><br/>But I wonder if there is not a real possibility that the disordered and self-serving thinking of our current president will reach a level of obviousness even his own supporters won’t be able to ignore it anymore.<br/><br/>I could imagine this happening once Trump inevitably says or does something that goes too far against his promises to and/or the values of his base in his never-ending quest for popularity and approval.<br/><br/>I am not a mental health professional. But even a lay person can see there is enough evidence now to support a reasonable conclusion he is personality disordered and suffers from a pathological level of narcissism and number of Machiavellian traits.<br/><br/>It is difficult to imagine Trump not ultimately self-imploding due to his inability to cooperate with others, accept advice, or admit any mistakes. <br/><br/>The way he turns on people, how will he retain the cooperation and loyalty of others necessary to maintain the false illusions he wants people to buy into about himself?<br/><br/>Trump now occupies a position that exposes him to what probably seems to him an intolerable level of criticism and scrutiny.<br/><br/>Used to buying secrecy, this new spotlight he can’t directly control is probably fueling his anxiety and rash statements, which reveal his extreme ignorance and dishonesty. <br/><br/>Methinks (hope) “the length truth will out.”"
"At times it seems Trump gets his Tweeting points frrom his friends on the TV that direct him toward a theme.  But other times it feels like he has an idea but other people help him with the words and concepts.<br/><br/>Trump is President,  But just like Obama I don't agree with his actions.  I don't think I have liked many of the presidents that were in office during my voting years. (am 54).  I even went so far as to announce on my Blog that I was running for the office in 2007,  But my ideas are more radical than bernie sanders.  Though I did agree with Trump's stated idea of why can't we be friends with Russia.  But unlike others, I'd try to be friends with every nation, and fight (pun intended) a war on wars.<br/><br/>Gerald Celente  wanted a Peace movement.  I have been for peace all my life.  But sadly the world is still a violent place and Peace is a hard things to get done in a world that worships Money.<br/><br/>So big wavy hands wall is in the works.  When everyone wants to escape to the places south of us, we will lament that wall.<br/><br/>Ban guns and hand everyone a flower and tell that is their new weapon.  "
Glad to see this judge is waking up.
"So the judge who ""El Presidente"" described as incapable of making objective determinations because of his  Mexican heritage has made one and response from the White House is.........nothing.  Another example of how the imposter in the White House is not able to demonstrate fitness for the office.  Admit you were wrong.  Not going to happen."
"The sanguine view of Judge Curiel's decision would be that he dispassionately rendered an opinion based only on his reading of the law; the more disturbing inference would be he was intimidated by Trump's bullying and caved.<br/>As others have suggested, he ought to have recused himself from this case and all others involving Mr. Trump.<br/>Of course, as time goes on, Mr. Trump may work his way through every judge and be left with only Mr. Gorsuch to sit in judgment of him."
"Thank you for the accurate description of how a narcissist like Trump uses public bullying, intimidation, and lying to generate public support for promoting his own interests. However, I think that Judge Curiel's ability to continue ""to do his job"" and adhere to principal speaks more to his job security as a judge than to anything else.<br/><br/>It's the protection and security of Judge Curiel's lifetime appointment that allows him to thumb his nose politely at Trump. Otherwise, he'd be faced with the same conundrum most people face: Navigating along a rocky road of compromises in one's integrity and dignity by attempting to please a boss or benefactor to maintain one's livelihood. Trump, the Republican Party, the NRA, private businesses for example, all successfully use threats of personal intimidation and job loss to stifle free speech and advance their agendas.<br/><br/>Trump's personality disorder and its influences merely serves to highlight the public benefit of an impartial judiciary that operates independently and without fear from personal threats or acts of retaliation."
"""In Mr. Trump’s world, nothing is sacred and everything is transactional.""<br/><br/>Yes, but even in the domain of transactions he's no great shakes.  Tony Schwartz's mythological creation notwithstanding, Trump has careened through a roller-coaster career with most of his time spent dragging stakeholders through the mud. Even now..."
Things are calm today because Kelly gave Trump a bowl of ice cream at lunch. The screaming tantrums may return by dinner.
"Not surprised at all by Trumps behaviors. <br/><br/>Trump would call the guy who mugs him and sticks a knife in his belly, ""a good, great guy"" - IF the guy asked for an autograph on a copy of ""The Art of The Deal."" <br/><br/>""Hey he's a fan...! Great guy...although a little erratic with sharp instruments..."""
"When will our media learn Donald Trump's secret of success - exaggeration and ""White Lies?""  Every Southerner and slick Yankee salesman learns how to exaggerate or embroider a story to keep enemies at bay, rivals off balance, and customers salivating.<br/><br/>Donald Trump's florid tastes and personality make hyperbole and falsehoods particularly useful for him and in business and politics. It's the Art of the Deal: you can use a good story to woe potential investors and buyers/fool attorneys and enthuse voters. A little crazy can empower negotiations or cover up bumbling ignorance.<br/>Ivanka understands this and plays along. Jared sort of gets it. The media seem clueless.<br/><br/>Good 'Ol Boy Jeff Sessions understood Trump's act until Jeff faced a prison term for lying to the FBI. Hope Hicks, educated at SMU, recognized Donald Trump's ""White Lies"", ""poetic license"", i.e. ""Southern hyperbole"" to promote his agenda and throw off the FBI/media.<br/><br/>Prior to modern communications systems, TV, and the internet, the South was boring. So, raconteurs learned to weave tall tales known to be exaggerated or even false, for entertainment or ulterior reasons. Trump is an adept raconteur (Shakespeare would hint skillful fool) for ulterior motives. Orange Man is a superb, entertaining bloviator, beloved by his voters and other wits. The crazier, the more Trump's voters love him. Thus far, it's kept Mueller and the whole FBI at bay. It's kept Kim Jong Un guessing. It may even keep Trump from impeachment."
kudos to Curiel
"Having worked in the federal courts in various ways for 30 years now, I have to say that Donald Trump was right to criticize Gonzalo Curiel almost two years ago.<br/><br/>The claims the plaintiffs made in the fraud case against Donald Trump (as opposed to the other defendants) were based on ""sales puffery"" and were too weak to withstand a motion to dismiss. Donald Trump had the only deep pockets, so if he were dismissed the plaintiffs would have gotten nothing. That's why Gonzalo Curiel would not dismiss the case. <br/><br/>Had the case gone to trial and appeal Donald Trump would have won. The plaintiffs may have been defrauded, but it wasn't by Donald Trump. While his words may have been ill-chosen, Donald Trump was right to criticize Gonzalo Curiel's decision. <br/><br/>The federal courts need more criticism like Donald Trump gave them. Federal judges have become American aristocracy. They are appointed for life. They sit on thrones dressed in robes and demand to be called ""your honor"".  Any one of the hundreds of them can stop even a president from doing his job. And no one can overrule their decisions except another member of the aristocracy. <br/><br/>That's crazy. Who gave them this awesome power? No one. They took it. "
"The definition of a ""good"" or ""bad: judge does not revolve around whether or not they find in your favor.<br/><br/>A good judge is one who knows the law, and applies it without fear or favor to a set of facts presented to them.<br/><br/>I guess that's just too sophisticated and nuanced of an idea for Trump to grasp. "
"The central theme here is Trump's personal and financial interests.  In this case, he is so eager to be ""right,"" that a win, even over a foolish and expensive wall, is more important than his biases.  On the other hand, had he lost, we'd surely have been reminded that Judge Curiel was ""bad,"" etc.  <br/><br/>Mr. Trump behaves like a 2 year old, and I say that with apologies to children.  Nothing matters outside himself.  No one else matters, with the possible exception of his family.  He trusts few outside his family; hence the rampant White House nepotism.  <br/><br/>He has to gloat because his fragile ego is always needy.  But tomorrow he may say something else, just as with his intermittent complaints about Mr. Sessions, one of Trump's earliest supporters."
"To say ""Donald Trump Gets a Lesson..."" suggests the man can learn.  Everything he says and does suggests that is not remotely possible."
"Put Trump in a room with legislators and it takes only seconds to see that his ignorance is clearly on display the moment of his first utterance. For a man who arrogantly boasts of his deal-making prowess, he is easier to play than a kindergartner. Just flatter Donald and he is putty in your hands. Dare to be a judge of Hispanic descent and he'll turn your ethnic makeup into the reason why you're corrupt and biased. What a fool!"
"Shorter NYT, again: ""We told you so."" It's doubtful that he cares. Again. "
"Oh yeah. How about Sen. John McCain, AG Jeff Sessions and commentator Mona Charen? They have all been trashed in these pages and now find favor with this newspaper as reasonable people. Look in the mirror today. "
"Gee, I wonder who Judge Curiel was referring to in his closing statement. Half the time I am disgusted that we have a juvenile for president or someone who never developed character so he never became an adult. The rest of the time I am just disgusted with the horror of a Trump sitting in our oval office.<br/><br/>""By the pricking of my thumb, something wicked this way comes."" The prologue to his 2300 and counting tweets made as 'president'."
I find it refreshing that the NYT has finally discovered that the Twitter crowd is full of twits.
"Being a terribly flawed, amoral human being is not, unfortunately, a disqualification for being elected President.  We've had other unprincipled egoists in the Oval Office, though none as transparently so as the current occupant.  Just because Trump behaves like the tinpot dictator of a banana republic doesn't mean we have become one.  But the absence of any principled leadership by the Congress---unless you count putting billions more in the pockets of billionaires as principled---is what has sent the country hurtling into plutocracy at home and irrelevance abroad.  The only ray of hope in this sordid mess is the capacity, in some isolated matters where money isn't the sole driver of policy, for less-than-superrich people to have their opinions heard by the politically powerful.  Both #MeToo and the Parkland kids are examples of this.  I only wish there were more."
"More Trump bashing ....nice picture ? Get over it , you got 8 years of Trump ."
Mr. Trump is a racist of the first order.
Congratulations to the Editorial Board for coming up with “brain squirt”. It has all the repellent descriptive power of the more common flatulent phrase while remaining “fit to print”.
Some 400 pound guy in a bathrobe on a bed in DC strikes again.
Editorial Board you have told me nothing new.  It is not news that Trump swings like a pendulum in his name calling.  One minute an individual will be praised and the next minute damned.  Trump's whirling dervish mind spins out contradictions faster than any NYT columnist can keep up with.  My advice is when Trump praises someone immediately draft a story about Trump's criticism of that person.  Then all you have to do is fill in the reason and push the print button when it happens.
"""As 280-character brain-squirts from America’s thumbiest commander in chief go, the one President Trump emitted late Tuesday night appeared harmless enough.""<br/><br/>Three hags I met in a forest told me that Trump would be all thumbs at being President; but, as Macbeth could have told me, I would not understand what they meant until it came to pass."
"Trump is mentally ill and a sociopath. I cannot imagine why anyone would want to work with or for him, be married to him, be related to him, or vote for him. He's is a big fat nothing in every sense of the word.<br/>I wish the media would stop covering him. Just don't cover him at all and see has fast he brings himself into line. He craves attention and the more he gets it the worse his narcissism becomes. Leave him completely alone. Do not cover him. Ignore him."
"I do believe trump is regressing in his behaviors, actions, and comments. I used to believe he acted like a 10 year old, but now he seems to act like a 4 year old. <br/><br/>""You're my friend. You're not my friend.""<br/>""I like you. I hate you.""<br/>""You are very smart. You are so stupid.""<br/><br/>Interesting, his nanny (""Hopey"") just quit, largely because of his behavior.<br/><br/>And I thought that course in developmental psychology was a waste of time. How old will trump be after 2 more years? And how many baby sitters will be required for his around-the-clock care?"
The proof is in the Putin'
"Once again, the NYT has it backwards. The Judge got a lesson from Trump- and learned from it."
"With all respect to Judge Curiel, I'm against building a wall but his previous tenure as the Chief of Narcotics  Enforcement Division makes him the expert on the perils of drug smuggling across the border from Mexico.  "
Trump’s word is as good as Walmart’s gold earring collection: 100% Fake! Next week he’ll have the NRA down to Mar-ugh-Lago for a barbecue and shooting range. Trump doesn’t stand for Trump any longer: there is nothing left of him!
"""very bad judg"" and ""big legal win"" tweets from Trump re Judge Curiel whom he maligned as only he can for beingf ""happens to be, we believe, Mexican.""  Face it, Trump is the most disgraceful president ever to live in our White Houjse and host visitors in our Oval Office and have 2 other White Houses at his dispolsal in NYC, NJ, and FL. Since when is an ignorant, narcisstic, braggart considered a public servant in our country?  Trump a servant?  NEVER in caps."
The imbecile-in-chief thinks that everything is about him.  Hopefully any monies going toward the ridiculous wall will be withheld.  With such an excess already going go needless military spending perhaps someone will draw a line.
That is a perfect portrayal of an unhinged president.
"The Judge did his job, he issued his ruling to his interpretation of the law not because of his heritage. This is something Trump could never do because he does not understand following the rules, obeying the law. Trump viciously put down the Judge because Trump assumes everyone thinks like him. Filled with prejudice, malice, and revenge, Trump has no capacity for empathy.  With Trump it's always about himself. With his presence, he shames America every day.<br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan"
"Trump is a conman.<br/><br/>I never take anything he says seriously.<br/><br/>It is a waste of time to ""analyze"" anything he says.<br/><br/>Watch what he does."
"First, attributing trump's behavior to his mental maladies is falling for his ploy of concealing his criminal behavior with stupidity. A mistake many in the media are still making.<br/>He is a traitor and criminal. He disrupts the U.S. institutions to aid Putin's group. He does so in exchange for Russian money received since the 90's.<br/>PROSECUTE RUSSIAGATE! "
"OK, Trump was wrong about Curiel, but were the plaintiffs in this case wrong as well.  How was he selected to preside over this matter?  Did the plaintiffs engage in some forum shopping in hopes of getting him?  And did the chief judge of the District Court select him because of Trump's past criticism?  Or was it completely random?  And did Curiel go out of his way to be fair to Trump in order to prove that he  was not biased?  But no matter.  California will appeal  and the Ninth Circuit will surely throw all the principles that Curiel articulated out the window, with the support of the NYT, and the case will go forward unless SCOTUS affirms Curiel's decision in a year or so.  <br/><br/>And of course it is laughable to hear the NYT criticizing Trump for not respecting democracy and the rule of law when it is clear that the left has no respect for democracy and the rule of law.  Why don't you tell us some day how you reconcile sanctuary cities with the rule of law and democracy?   And the Constitution!"
"No worries, El Presidente will never learn about this because Fox won't cover it."
"It was interesting how the media reported on Judge Curiel during the 2016 campaign. They reminded us he was born in Indiana so he is an American. He's a respected judge. Therefore, of course, he will be impartial. <br/><br/>What they failed to report on was that Judge Curiel is a member of the Hispanic Judges Association. He is a board member on the American Bar Association's Hispanic lawyer committee. He is a member of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association and La Raza Lawyers of California. La Raza translates to ""the race"".  <br/><br/>It's not exactly a stretch of reasonableness to question whether he might maybe, just maybe, have a little bias when it comes to issues ""Hispanic"".<br/><br/>At the same time we followed the case of Brock Turner, the Stanford student accused of sexual assault. The judge in that case, Aaron Persky, also a respected judge, was a Stanford alum. <br/><br/>When Judge Persky handed down a sentence that the media deemed to be too light, they cried foul. Out came the villagers with their pitch forks demanding Judge Persky be removed. He couldn't be impartial because of his alma mater. <br/><br/>Trump is an inarticulate, bloviating philistine. He seems to be completely paranoid about his public image and is clearly obsessed with winning even the smallest battles. But, in the words of the author Delmore Schwartz ""even paranoids have real enemies."""
With the stipulation that nothing that Trump said was anything other than pandering that will be null as soon as the next pretty face or pile of cash enters the room.  Watching the Republicans in the room squirm as the Lord of the Flies revealed them for the NRA owned bespoke empty suits they are was shadinfroidious!
"The whole notion that a federal judge of the United States of America is anything other than, well, a US citizen was always a ridiculously ignorant and embarrasing (to himself) thing to say.  It also embarassed those who want to support him/his agenda."
"“It’s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn’t care.”<br/>No - he is counting on Americans’ notoriously short historical memory, betting that we will not notice yet another instance of his bottomless hypocrisy."
"A legal victory for a man for whom no laws apply. The only man in the entire county who cannot be indicted, unless he is removed from office first. Our laws are not blind, they are, however, blinded. Nixon violated countless criminal statutes, and what happened to him? He got early retirement with full benefits. He left on a helicopter waving and smiling.<br/><br/>There are people sitting in jail right now because they j-walked. Meanwhile, our racist leader lines his pockets as he spits on the emoluments clause. Trump, like most of his party, uses the Constitution like a piece of Charmin.<br/><br/>Have no delusions, and make no mistake, ""Laws are for little people"", not Great Men like Donald Trump."
"I never thought I would have an opportunity to praise Jeff Sessions, but I do admire him for having the integrity to refuse to do Trump’s bidding regarding the FISA court.  Sessions has many flaws, but he appears to have found the courage to try to uphold the past standards and ethics of the Justice Department.<br/><br/>I wish the media would stop reporting all the baloney that comes out of Trump’s mouth and his fingers.  Trump’s only objective is to capture all the neon, and he certainly has achieved that goal.  <br/><br/>Trump is the most incompetent, crude, bullying, ignorant, and thoughtless elected person in the entire United States.  His departure from the White House can come soon enough!!! "
"If President Hillary (heavy sigh) pulls something like this, is the reaction any different than, ""it's just Don being Don""."
"Isn't the bigliest point here that ""the judge rejected a challenge by the State of California and several environmental groups to the administration's WAIVER of Environmental Laws...""?  <br/><br/>Waiving environmental laws...that, to me, is the most disturbing thing."
"all authoritarian leaders including those who went on to be dictators started by attacking judges and rule of law.Then, they try to bend police and other apparatus of law and order to their will. "
"Most other democracies, cabinate members are first elected by their constituents AND THEN appointed to their positions....accountability to the people as well as the boss"
"Trump does remember and he certainly doesn't care about Judge Curiel. Trump is a psychopath who simply sees everyone else as a prop he can manipulate or a sucker he can gain from.<br/><br/>This is clear from Trump's record, and it stems from his position of self-entitlement as a rich brat who has always abused the power of wealth that he was born with.<br/><br/>So if you help or commend him, you get his high praise. Not because he likes you, but because you might do more for him.<br/><br/>If you oppose or offend him, you get ruthlessly bullied. Not because he hates you, but because he wants to make it harder for you to do any more damage.<br/><br/>And you can go from one to the other with the same results -- look at how quickly he changed his fickle ""opinions"" on Mitt Romney and Darth Bannon based on things they said about him.<br/><br/>This weathervane approach makes him a terrible public servant because it makes him personally reflexive to what has just happened and wholly without vision as to what would help the rest of us.<br/><br/>Ironically, while the Branch Donaldians are convinced Trump is truthful because he speaks his mind and is not PC, he really is more politically dishonest than any other politician because he has zero convictions.<br/><br/>Not yet anyhow. Godspeed, Mr Mueller!"
"March 1, 2018<br/><br/>Well once again Trump needs to learn about our political legal posture and its impact on his imagination that tweets and tweets but would be better advised to adapt to judgment of world class honest truthful journalism like herewith. All for the good of doing what is established as needs and acts that are representative of our mature culture and historic antecedents that are time honored and will prevail any aberrations by civil servants in need of refinement for living well, smart, and safe in our complex world.<br/>jja Manhattan, N.Y.   "
"Not so fast. Judges who are publicly criticized, or for that matter praised, by the president, are still human beings whether are labeled ""US"" or ""we think, Mexican"" (depending upon a decision's effect on to Trump). <br/><br/>It is entirely inappropriate for a president to publicly make personal comments about a sitting judge. A president could properly praise a given decision, but should not personally praise the judge (for making it). A president could decry a decision, but not the judge. <br/><br/>Trump does not understand or respect the differences between judicial functions and politics. The separation of powers that the founders enshrined are but pearls before swine to Trump. He treats everything as his person political stage where he can do his act. He treats everyone as props upon his political stage. <br/><br/>A  judge who makes repeated or grossly wrong decisions should be removed from office, but that is not the Presiden't job. There is no proper place for public presidential critique of judges themselves, where their families come from, or anything personal."
Judge Curiel went easy on Trump wot he the conspiracy to defraud case last time. I wanted that case to go to trial and not let Trump buy his way out.<br/>It just proved that people with money have special privileges.  Serious charge like that should’ve had some time served involved. Curiel chickened out.
"Judge Curiel would be an infinitely better president than the one we currently have in the White House.  In fact, there are probably millions of Americans who would be better.  What a travesty."
I am not that sure that Trump cares mostly for winning or is even sure what it is.  I know that what he enjoys the most is fighting and outraging.
"MJ questions the Times' characterization of President Trump as commander in chief. Years ago as a college political science student I learned that our president plays a variety of roles, including head of state, CEO, chief diplomat, commander in chief, and head of his party. Other countries do it differently. An example would be the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth is the head of state, and the prime minister is left to focus on most of these other roles. The commander of chief role is especially important, because we do want the president to command the military and so to hopefully avoid the problems you have in third world countries where the military has a separate commander who can make trouble and threaten to seize power if he's unhappy about something."
"You give the man too much credit for thinking, it's pathetic. He's nothing more than reactionary, gloating on pleasure from attention no matter from where it comes and hating all else. Evident in his offish televised wish -- however fleeting until someone else fauns all over him -- to remove peoples' guns without Due Process. (No personal hypocrisy there!) He's a man who cannot fathom anything past his own ego. That is not a brain. It's barely a bacteria. A flu virus mutates quicker than Trump can come up with an original solution to anything. Playing both sides of every argument is not a mind bent upon doing anything. It's a mind resigned to its own idiocy. He's been played by others his whole life, which is why he's especially thin-skinned and vindictively reactionary to that very notion, and resorts to the only thing a feeble brain can devise: juvenile insults."
"I was intrigued by the odd suggestion in the article that Trump was celebrating his court victory ""in a bathrobe"". How do we know that and why should anyone care?<br/><br/>I followed the corroborating link, and found only a year-old reference to a general Trump propensity for ""watching television in his bathrobe"".<br/><br/>This is not an isolated instance of apparently substantiating links which do not substantiate. I am finding it increasingly essential to follow such links, and they do not enhance the credibility of Times journalism."
"In the very near future Donald Trump will make reference to Judge Curiel as an example of how even the judicial opposition is awed and overpowered by his leadership, an example of how a bad judge can be made a good judge by watching the President in action.  Trump is the master at what Jim McKay woud call ""stealing a victory from the jaws of defeat"".<br/><br/>And now that I have your attention, in another unrelated but related article in today's NYT it appears that someone has submitted a ""forged"" nomination of Donald J. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.  He's on a roll."
"""Laws and norms, ethics and principles? Meaningless concepts. In Mr. Trump’s world...""<br/><br/>That world--remember is the ""free [from law, logic and ethics] market.""  <br/><br/>Say anything--advertise anything, especially self advertising--that will reap a profit, bilking others. <br/><br/>Caveat emptor applies to voters in spades."
"As E.J. Dionne said on NPR last week: Trump doesn't have any values, only interests.<br/><br/>Trump also is cognitively, psychologically, and socially damaged--and that is a lot of damage for anyone, much less the President of the United States.  <br/><br/>Trump is  so damaged that he fails to process how he appears to others (it's either ""for me"" or against ""me""), the consequences of HIS often impulsive and self-centered and self-serving decisions, or even why truth matters in his addictive quest for fame and fortune.  <br/><br/>Thus, completely lacking in nuance and almost totally devoid of a conscience, the egocentric, simpleminded and narcissistic Trump misses the entire point about ethics, laws, and precedent and views Judge Curiel only in relation to Trump.  <br/><br/>And I am pretty sure Trump will not grasp the meaning and implications of Judge Curiel's principled and nuanced statement:<br/>“Courts are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions are entrusted to our nation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.”<br/><br/>In fact, I doubt Trump even cares, and that is our American tragedy to deal with--but, of course, the Republicans willfully will not. "
"Great job skewering Trump, but I’m sure he doesn’t care. He just cares about “winning.” He probably rhinks his earlier criticism of the judge put pressure on him not to rule against Trump’s wall."
"""Flipping"" is one of the markers for someone diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.  People who struggle with a borderline personality struggle to maintain emotional connection with people because they either lift people up as ""Good"" or bring then down as ""Bad.""  Borderline personalities create chaos in whatever group they are apart of.  They are unpredictable.  They are recreating their own inner chaos.  People start to feel the borderline's rage and if they cannot express that rage they will feel depressed.  Sound familiar?  Is that not what he is creating in our nation and I suspect in those who work with him?<br/><br/>It is a very difficult disorder to treat because if is formed very early on in the un-empathetic (or unemotionally attuned) interactions of caregivers with a not-yet-verbal child.  Trump is like a very young child who sees the world as either good or bad in any particular moment.  Part of me wants to feel concerned and sad for him, but it is just so scary to think this when he is in charge of our military and our nuclear weapons as well as the pain he is cause so many close to him and our nation."
Don’t we already know that the man has no moral values? Such old news now. What is frightening about this piece is the waiver of environmental laws that are in place for good reason. Now that is terrifying.
"The bully in chief thinks he won by securing this ruling. In a way I wish Judge Curiel had not heard the case since I think this just inflated Trumps huge ego even more. He won against the ""Mexican"""
"If a Democrat gets into office in 2020, I'd love to see Curiel nominated for SCOTUS."
"Although you raise an interesting historical irony Editorial Board, any belief, if only to the least possible degree, that it would somehow be acknowledged by our Fake President is tantamount to a trickle of water penetrating ten feet of granite. A narcissist is a narcissist is a narcissist, to paraphrase G. Stein."
"A moral victory for Judge Curiel but an environmental, social, and political disaster. What are we celebrating exactly? "
"Go ahead, begrudge Trump because he can't hold a grudge as long as you can."
"As the crooks in one of Will Shakespeare's plays pointed out. If one wants to take over the government and be tyrants, one has to get rid of all the lawyers first.   Unlike Donald Trump, when,  over 30 years ago, I was sworn in as an attorney, I took my oath to support and defend the USA, the Constitution and the laws upon which the country stands, very seriously. I still do.   In my view, trump is a traitor, putting his own ego over the responsibility to govern wisely. "
"Trump is, after all, the whole Republican Party personified.  When the rules do what I want, I'm for law and order, when they don't, I've got all kinds of reasons that they are bad.  That includes, of course Rand disciple Paul Ryan and Smiling Mitch.  Most children by the age of 10 have gotten past this fundamental ethical incapacity."
"Don't know what's in the heart or mind of the judge, then or now, but point of fact: It worked.  He's president."
"Trump's actions and reactions are quite predictable to any child development (and mal-development) professional. He is unable to postpone gratification, a skill that even young children posses. For him his wishful thinking is reality: if he wants something he expects to be given it instantly. Obviously he thinks he is still in a reality show, but apparently he was like that even in his younger age. He views other people from the point of self: whether they are doing his bidding at the moment (which may change without  warning). He wants to be adored and will buy friendship with gifts. That's why at his school he was both a bully but also popular. He does not really have a fragile ego: his ego is minimal if any at all, as is his super-ego. He is all ""id"". God Help America -  3 more years!!!"
Trump is and always has been a con man.  The fact that he is now president changes nothing.
You're assuming Trump has enough intelligence to remember it is the same judge.  Very generous of you.
"Interesting. It says a lot to be sure which the NYTimes has covered well. Its an irony of collasal strengt. But hold on here. How on God's Green Earth did this so called honest judge not recuse himself from this case? I might know the answer to this but still. Liberals- of which I am one to be sure- are too darn quick to fall on this story as some revelation, which it no doubt is, for some gain. Judges like to brag how they are outside of emotion and political persuasion and wear a blindfold when it comes to judgement. But there is a reason for recusal and he should have used it. Its as if he was showcasing his non bias expertise . Which if you have one does not need to be bolstered up. In the end he would need to rule in favor. Or else. And if he did ""or else"" his decision would have been open for appeal.  "
"You may be 180 degrees wrong on how this is perceived.  Rather than assuming that Trump should feel chagrined, he and his adherents are likely to think that ruling in favor of Trump is a direct result of the ""tough"" treatment that the judge received during their last interaction.  The judge would never want to go through that again, heavens no!  Thanks to Trump's tough talk, from  now on he will behave like a good judge should!  <br/><br/>Please NYT, if you want to describe the lessons Trump with get, unfortunately you need to also be able to think like him. "
"In years to come, trump and his (hopefully) one term presidential scandals will far supersede the Teapot Dome Scandal, other Grant scandals, and Kennedy's nude swimming parties. His need for vindication and self gratification are so transparent it's embarrassing."
Judicial branch still holding as Trump picks away at foundation of democracy.
Here exposed is the conservatives' 'deep state'. Public servants doing their job well. Here is why YOU must get involved to encourage our best and brightest to get involved in public service at all levels. It matters and the Trump Gang that Can't Shoot Straight shows why. 
Trump probably thinks he “won” because he previously bullied Curiel.  He has no concept of rule-of-law or intellectual honesty.
"Sociology 101 says the FIRST time someone sees information about a topic tends to form his/her views and it takes SEVEN ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVES to change that person's mind.  One thing DT does supremely ""well"" is to lie..early and often..and the media picks it up instantly and ""boom"" it's the canon law to a huge number of our fellow citizens.  Since it does it over and over and over and over and the media repeat it over and over and over and over of COURSE it takes hold in people's minds. I wish NYT and WAPO had a page somewhere far back in the papers that listed what DT said on a given day rather than giving him headlines on pages 1 and 3."
"Judge Curiel left an Easter egg in his opinion: ""As fellow Indiana native Chief Justice Roberts observed in addressing a case surrounded by political disagreement..."""
"One has to wonder what it must be like to be Donald Trump, oblivious and incurious to most things, existing in his private gilded sphere where everything he does is perfect and the best and anything bad is not merely excised, but erased. He is the definition of ignorance of bliss."
Leadership is when you share credit and take blame.  The exact opposite is...something else.
"Steering the ""Ship of State"" with Trump at the helm is like watching this Ship go through the Bermuda Triangle every day.We are all scared and nauseated and ready for calmer waters."
Another show from our favorite stable genius:  one side of his mouth has no idea  what comes out of the other.
"One still can't help but wonder if the judge's decision was, even a little bit, influenced by the bully who would no doubt jump all over him. This is one of the problems with an autocratic bully who has no filters. His influence on future behavior of others cannot be dismissed. So was there some subconscious effect on the decision?"
"The president could learn a valuable lesson in public service after his court victory regarding his border wall. The judge he disparaged turned a blind eye to the personal insults he received from the president and rendered his decision with a blindfold on, the way justice is meant to be rendered. <br/><br/>If he can stop gloating long enough, the president will understand the meaning of the rule of law, which means disregarding personal insults. Judge Curiel showed the president exactly how American jurisprudence should work. "
"What is amazing to me is that Trump has about a third of the Republican Party like Nunes and Ryan hurting our democracy to protect Trump.<br/><br/>And the rest of the Republican Party stands by silent.<br/><br/>Of course, the Republican Party just past a tax cut for the billionaires, too.<br/><br/>Someone making $75,000 will get about $7,000 in tax deductions over the next ten years.<br/><br/>At the same time, we will add at least $10 Trillion to the debt or about $67,000 per tax payer.<br/><br/>So for $7,000 in tax relief, he got $67,000 added to his credit card.<br/><br/>Maybe I shouldn't be surprised Nunes and Ryan have no morals, don't care about integrity and democracy, and are protecting Trump."
"Equally, if not more, disturbing than Trump's total absorption in himself and his lack of principles, are those people and organizations who turn a blind eye to Trump's utter unfitness for the Presidency, as long as whatever motivates Trump results in him taking positions that happen to be favorable to them.  "
"Just stop the world and let me off.  HE is Malice in Wonderland, and every single day is a new misadventure.  Thanks, GOP.  YOU deserve Him.  The rest of us, not so much."
"Arguably, Mr. Trump revealed his autocratic bent when at a rally in 2016 he said ""I will tell you, this court system -- the judges in this court system, federal court.""<br/>""They ought to look into that Judge Curiel because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace. OK? But we'll come back in November.<br/>Wouldn't that be wild if I'm president and I come back to do a civil case?”<br/><br/>He also showed a disturbing amount of repetition for a presidential candidate in his claims of “I’m building a wall. It’s an inherent conflict of interest. He's<br/>Mexican.""<br/>That aura of authoritarianism: Someone not favoring him is therefore utterly unethical and untrustworthy. His belief a judge should be disqualified-- if not entirely removed-- if a person being sued had prejudices.<br/>The warning signs came early.<br/>Bottom line: Few women or minorities have been appointed as federal judges by Mr. Trump."
"This is a repetition of a dozen things we already know. The substance of the legal decision is ignored. There are environmental consequences to allowing a wall to be built along the border, but the substance of the decision is ignored in favor of the schoolyard fisticuffs over the local bully."
I commend the Editorial Board for its direct characterizations of Donald Trump.  The President's character is so clearly so bad that to so thoroughly denigrate him seems entirely natural and appropriate.  We should never forget that this is the kind of President we have.  Thanks to the Editorial Board for continuing to say so.
"None of this will move Trump's worldview an inch.  Even though he probably recognizes that this is the same judge he previously maligned, I suspect Trump believes that this more favorable ruling is a result of his prior tweeting"
"Trump never said Curiel was biased because of his Mexican heritage; he said Curiel MIGHT BE biased because of Trump's harsh lingo on illegal immigration coupled with the judge's Mexican heritage and advocacy on behalf of illegal immigrant Latinos. There's a difference.<br/>That the judge has proven his ability to be fair might not surprise anyone, but let's not pretend Trump's concerns at the time were illegitimate, if way past timely. Concerns over judge and jury impartiality play out every day in this country. The onus very clearly was on the judge, given the soft spot in his heart for illegal immigrants. Many with clear minds have no trouble seeing a possible conflict. But politics dictates whether one sees Trump's concerns as racist or just normal everyday legal maneuvering."
"""It’s possible that Mr. Trump simply forgot who Judge Curiel is. More likely, he knows full well and doesn’t care.""<br/>I'd say he finds it embarrassing and as he has demonstrated in the past - he will ignore it completely because recognizing it would mean<br/>1. being wrong on his character assessment of the judge<br/>2. he learns from it and publicly acknowledges his error in judgement<br/>3. a desire to better yourself as a person<br/>I genuinely feel there is a big portion of Trump's supporter who share these characteristics and Obama's ability to let the situation and facts influence his judgment is what seemed to them as weak and capitulating, race aside. "
That is one interpretation judicial independence despite the litigant.  Another interpretation was that Judge  Curiel was bullied and intimated by Trump and it took 101 pages to tilt the law in Trumps favor
"True, but the most important thing is that Judge Curiel ruled in favor of the Wall, win for President Trump. As for Curiel being a ""very bad judge,"" Trump is correcting that problem by appointing judges to the Federal bench who do not legislate from the bench and who interpret the Constitution as the Founding Fathers meant for it to be interpreted, not reading better the lines. The Trump appointees are part of the long range goal of reforming America Into that nation for which the original Patriots fought and died. Would they have fought for what America has become? I do not know, but in the end Trump will triumph triumphantly. I support the President. I support Trump. Thank you. "
"Amazingly, Trump's own sister is a federal judge, a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Even so, he rides roughshod over decency and common sense when he has anything to say about the federal judiciary. There isn't a scintilla of integrity, consistency, or truth in anything he says or does, and there is no concern whatsoever for the long term stability of our democracy. To Mr. Trump, it's all about what he has to do or say to gain today's advantage, petty as it may be."
"I do not agree with the effects of this border wall ruling, though I must admit that I have not read it.  But I do respect the courts in their difficult task of finding consistent fair law.  In this a judge is charged with the duty of transcending personality and ego, to go beyond the moment to see the whole.  This standard is something Trump has completely forsaken and has probably not understood at all.  Trump is a product of a large segment of our citizens who expect Trump to be just like them, feckless, irresponsible  and subject to the whims of the moment.  Perhaps some of us will take to heart the civics lesson Trump has unwittingly given us in his negative way, but probably not."
"If this decision, which will hopefully be overturned on appeal, was motivated by a desire to punish the American people for electing Trump despite the overwhelming negative consequences of building the wall then it hardly stands as a good example of public service.  More like a judicial stick in the eye to the public."
"Agreed.<br/>Thank you, NYTimes.<br/>Please keep him accountable.<br/>Principles matter."
"Perhaps that judge got a lesson from Trump, and now at least a little is following the law and the constitution, not his personal desires.  The president has the same first amendment rights as we do, some object when he exercises them, I don't."
"Trump belongs in a nursery school learning how to share the spotlight, share his toys, and get along with others.  And, while it is true that it's not the role of the courts to protect us from the consequences of our political choices, Trump did not win the popular vote.  He won the Electoral College and that college failed in its mission to prevent a supremely unqualified, dishonest, and impulsive man from winning the presidency.  "
"""This all-consuming self-interest leads him to change his opinion of people and institutions, depending on how he thinks they are treating him at that moment.<br/>""Laws and norms, ethics and principles? Meaningless concepts. In Mr. Trump’s world, nothing is sacred and everything is transactional.""  Excellent description.  But NY Times Editorial Board, please keep in mind this observation when announcing any change in Trump's opinion about gun control.  Any change for the better is welcome, but from someone you have just described, in seemingly endless reminder?  Regarding that proof of the pudding, I'm waiting to eat."
“Courts are vested with the authority to interpret the law
"""This is a man who is so much more interested in winning than in governing that he filed for re-election the same day he was inaugurated.""<br/>Every politician understands that ""winning"" is a prerequisite for governing; winning elections is their primary objective. Trump is in no way remarkable for this. "
"I accept the diversity of human beings that make up our world. Most people exist with 5 basic emotions (anger, fear, joy/sadness, grief, worry) although from time to time I have encountered some that only seem to express two (guilt and jealousy). Trump is one of those and he is our president.<br/><br/>We know what Trump is, but more to the point, why does he still have so many that support him, and I dare say, even love and admire him? It seems to me that this is the most relevant question that must be figured out or we will never rid ourselves of this cracker. And, we desperately need to define what is America of tomorrow, and what it means to be an American in a context that reflects our evolving diversity, the influence of globalization, and the ebb and flow of expantion and contraction of our dreams.<br/>What we cannot let happen is to ever allow Trump to get inside our humanity and turn us into fearful, hate mongering, racist jealous trolls. The future of America is not turning inward and rolling back the clock. It is to fearlessly reach out..."
Yet another article of some length which covers in detail one idiocy of Trump. I suggest that the NYT covers each of the many such items as single paragraphs in one article and devotes the rest of the paper's coverage to the USA and world items that could keep the readers more informed.
"Donald Trump is one damaged man. Empathy is #5 on a card. Cabinet meetings are conducted  North Korean style with praise for Dear Leader. School shootings turn into his personal fantasy of being a superhero.<br/>Life for The Donald is has and always will be about HIM. The greatest most brilliant and successful man ever born in the history of the universe. The GOP and his 'base' have embraced this ideology wholeheartedly. The Donald stages rallies across our fair land to receive the adulation.<br/>This monumental ego has driven Trump to believe that his special place in the world entitles him to act in any way he pleases. Rules, laws, ethics and respect for anyone else are not required and do not apply to him. And he has gotten away with this for his entire life because he was born with Fred's money.<br/>Trump has never been held accountable for any of his actions or words. Try that and he and Roy Cohen used scorched earth legal tactics to bully and slander any foe. Apparently Jeff Sessions didn't get the memo and Trump hates him for not being his personal pit bull at the DOJ. It's no fun being POTUS with all the power if you can't go after your foe with malice, cruelty and a vengeful heart.<br/>At 71 there are no lessons for Donald Trump. He is a malignant narcissist who can not hear or learn, respect or love. It's all about him 24/7/365."
Trump only cares about one thing - Trump.
"I know it is cathartic to express this kind of stuff. But we are more than 5 years into the nationally political Donald Trump. We know what a low-life he is. New Yorkers have been burdened with the guy for much longer. It is now time to focus on his deeds, his actions as President. If he does something horrible, call him on it. If he does, or has done, something impeachable, impeach him. If he somehow lasts until 2020, vote him out.<br/><br/>Take all the emotional energy and focus it on deeds, actions, and mobilizing in opposition."
"Judge Gonzalo Curiel, native of Indiana: so he is both Mexican and Indian ?!<br/><br/>Furthermore he seems like a very good professional, and working for the government.<br/><br/>I am completely lost. At least tax cuts will correct all this."
"To understand how The Conman's pea brain works, listen to WNYC's &amp; ProPublica's ""Trump, Inc."" podcast. A recent episode had Abraham Wallach, the Executive VP for Acquisitions &amp; Finance for The Conman from 1991-2002. While he has numerous criminal convictions himself, he had interesting tales to tell about The Cheeto Von Tweeto &amp; how he works his ""deals""."
 “I could settle that case. … I don’t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I’m a man of principle.” <br/><br/>These are my principles. If you don't like them I have others. - Groucho Marx
"Sorry Luettgen, it is painfully obvious Sessions isn't going anywhere. Apparently he has integrity! You might want to add this word to your vocabulary once you figure out what it means."
"The ""president"" doesn't care about the rule of law, or debate, or due process.<br/>He has proved time and time again that he wants one thing only.<br/>Loyalty.<br/>On top of being a white supremacist, compulsive liar and a bully, (all documented), the Donald is a spoiled rotten 6 year old who never reads.<br/>He tweets and watches Fox And Friends.<br/>If you agree with him, he loves you.<br/>If you disagree with him, he will smear you."
"I guess, in Trumpworld, it still is all about if you side with him or not. Explains why he defended the White Supremists in Charlottesville. I doubt he is really a White Supremist, Second Amendment devotee, or out and out racist. He is just opposed to anyone who might be a threat to his image of himself as the Greatest. Mohammed Ali (AKA Cassius Clay) at least WORKED for the title. Trump just thinks his presence earns him the title."
When will this corrupt fraud get removed from office?
"all true and should be pointed out and criticized.<br/><br/>but it's like shouting at wall when you deal with the whiner in chief.<br/><br/>poor meek, mild America needed a thug to stop those mean other countries from picking on them.<br/><br/>turned out well so far."
Congressional republican leadership are spineless and dumb .  Ryan and McConnell are simply terrible people who will not put our country ahead of their baseless party. Vote in November America save our country from corruption and impeach as soon as possible .
"Trump's favorite new word is 'disgrace.'' I Wonder what his youngest son thinks about that. Perhaps that is why he never seems to smile, but hangs his had in shame."
"judge Curiel showed impartiality. The same unfortunately can not be said for supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, In a recent public speaking outing, Ms Ginsburg blamed Hillary Clinton's electoral loss on misogyny. I'm sure Ms. Ginsburg's social and political views never, ever... rear their ugly heads in her judicial decisions.....calling half the voting population sexist...very impartial."
"Just another example of how Trump cares little for facts and has zero shame. In the end, everybody, even the GOP, will get burned by him. That his way."
"I am sad to say that this editorial is a waste of ink (or pixels).  Just another self-affirming observation in our own comfortable echo chamber.  There are no more intellectual points to be made or emotional succor to be gained in pointing out the obvious, our president is simply a bum.  <br/><br/>We should be using the Times editorial page to move on from calling out the insanity and focus on pulling the country together, one small step at a time.   Identify the narrowest area of national consensus and support the grass roots movements sophisticated enough to avoid taking partisan positions.   It only takes one small step forward, working together, to see the next opportunity.  "
"There have always been narcissistic con-artists like Trump.  The part that’s hard to wrap my brain around is that so many Americans are willing to be duped by a purveyor of snake oil.  It’s self-delusion on an industrial scale.  Whether PT Barnum actually said it or not, it’s true:  there’s a sucker born every minute."
You can bet that right-wing bloggers will contend that Judge Curiel ruled as he did to escape another taste of the president's rightful wrath. 
"The dominoes are falling one by one, and they will eventually topple Trump if he doesn't explode beforehand in a cloudburst from his own natural gas.<br/><br/>Kushner's betrayal of his nation for personal financial gain is merely the latest domino to fall. The scandals have increased from weekly to daily to hourly. <br/><br/>And even Trump's attempts to curry national favour by reversing his stance on gun laws smack of sheer desperation, like a punch-drunk boxer hoping to land a lucky blow.<br/><br/>Hopefully Trump's implosion will take the entire GOP down with him and simultaneously encourage the Democrats to rethink their nation's priorities. Hint: Make infrastructure, not war."
"Surely the VSG ""knows"" that it was his previous criticism that caused the judge to rule in his favor this time; no one could possibly oppose him again after that withering attack!"
"Of course, if Judge Curiel later rules against a case concerning the White House, he'll go right back to being a ""Mexican"", aka a ""bad hombre"".  Political correctness, right wing division, has its own strict parameters."
"Wondering if there is a medication or therapy to help heal a 'congenital' liar, one born with that ailment.  This is the case with Trump.  This type of liar will truly not remember his lies.  He lives, as others point out, in the moment.  If called on a lie, he will deny it.  A typical reaction of someone with this terrible disease.<br/><br/>Hope Hicks, Sanders, and others 'lie' for him when necessary.  If they don't they are Sessionized (insulted frequently), or forced to resign.<br/><br/>And, 35% of the US population love him.  Gadzooks!"
"I'm still waiting to see a positive comment about Trump in the NYT.He is a flawed human being with who can be turned easily into a caricature.The Times and many of the commentators here miss no opportunity to point it out.He wants to have a secure border and providing it is his duty.The ""environmentalist"" and the State of California are more concerned about the illegals than citizens and try phony issues to stop the President.Good for the judge to take the side of the the law.Hope the frequently overturned 9th circuit listens."
"I wasn't surprised that Judge Curiel followed the letter of the law, which apparently wasn't written with powerful fools in mind.<br/><br/>I was surprised that Trump didn't crow that the ruling was due to him beating his ""Mexican"" enemy into submission.  Must be saving that for his next rally in Texas."
“280 character brain-squirts” <br/><br/>Best description of Trump tweets ever -comic and repulsive at the same time. Brilliant!!
Finally we have a president who is dedicated to protecting our borders.<br/><br/>Democrats will continue to lose political ground if they support open borders and illegal immigration.  Those who abet illegal immigration like the mayor of Oakland should be imprisoned.<br/><br/>Look at the tattooed  MS 13 thugs that parade around our streets.  Why aren't these obvious criminals not arrested and immediately deported. Maybe it is because the local governments are too busy arresting a million people a year for marijuana.<br/><br/>Legalize marijuana and use the tax money to build a wall and arrest a million illegal immigrants a year instead of harmless pot users.
I believe Trump has an app on his phone :Donald Trump's Mad Lib Tweets. All he has to do is fill in the blanks with the names he despises and hit send.  
"""Big legal win""  and ""Very Bad Judge"" -  tweets from Trump re Judge Curiel whom he maligned as only he can for being ""happens to be, we believe, Mexican.""  Face it, Trump is the most disgraceful president ever to live in our White House. to host visitors for the past year in our Oval Office and have three other White Houses at his disposal in NYC, NJ, and FL. Since when fo we consider an ignorant, narcissistic, braggart a public servant in our country?  Trump a servant?  NEVER in caps."
"If Trump's ham-handed efforts to undermine the judiciary, the press, law enforcement, and legislators and others who have the temerity to disagree with him weren't so appalling and damaging to our system of governance they would be laughable.  His weapons of choice are insults, lies and threats.  This buffoon is straight out of a junior high school playground nd yet he's the President.  How did this happen? ( Answer:  a toxic mix of benighted voters who couldn't get over their hatred of HRC, Putin, a GOP who wanted a win at ANY cost, and a feckless Democratic Party that repeatedly shot itself in the foot )<br/> Please God, make it stop!"
"Trump's lack of humanity  and ethics are well documented.  What is most revealing are the shameless opportunists in congress who ""support"" him in order to serve themselves as well."
"To call Trump and angry middle schooler would be an insult to middle schoolers. How can anyone, excepting the tainted GOP, support this child in old man's clothing. "
"I love reading the moaning pain of America's left.   Its  ""delicious""."
When will our ring side view of this very sick man end?
"Doesn't matter who the judge is, as long as we get that ruling, most of us Republicans don't care"
"Is there somewhere I can read the NY Times assessment of Judge Curiel's ruling? I already know how the Times feels about trump, I see it daily on most items in politics and opinions."
"One thing is missing from both the editorial and comments so I will state it here-“another judge legislating from the bench”.  It is comical whenever a ruling is against our Dear Leader he and his easily conned followers will start that screech.  So, I just had to say it."
"No, no, noooo.  Fakedonald does not take lessons from anyone.  He is untrainable.  He learned everything he needed to know from his father and Wharton Real Estate teachers.  In fact he taught a lesson how to rule correctly, that is favorable to him - that is the only way.  Fake Donald, you won, judicial indepenence lost!"
"The wall will never be built, much less paid for by Mexico. It's a standard red meat teaser at his pep rallies. It's get's the anti immigration, rascist, crowds blood boiling. Now, it not even a wall..just an extended chain link fence in the middle of now where, separating the sage brush from the sage brush "
"We can only hope that the president continues to show flexibility in his decisions as we all do in business.  This is driving the liberal press berserk as they can't seem to pin anything on Trump.  Also, we can only hope that Trump gets another opportunity to appoint a Supreme.  The country needs to come back to it roots of less activist judges making law as they go along.  Law that was approved by the democratic process.  Let's face it.  Obama tried to change America to look like the world his mother yearned for.  A socialists utopia that had no borders or law enforcement."
"The worst aspect of Trump's narcissism, cupidity, ignorance and xenophobia is that they personify the narcissism, cupidity, ignorance and xenophobia of the nation that elected him president."
"“I could settle that case. … I don’t want to settle the case. Because you know what? Because I’m a man of principle.” <br/><br/>Ha!. Funniest thing I've read in days.<br/>The only principle Trump has is ME ME ME ME!!!<br/><br/>I'm hoping Mueller takes a look at Ryan and McConnell.<br/>They have both broken their Oath of Office, putting the GOP before the Constitution. They let an unfit man continue as POTUS.<br/>Their refusal to have Congress act on Russian hacking when Obama informed them was treasonous."
"When you elect Trump, you get Trump.<br/>Obvious, really."
The only thing delicate about Donald Trump is his ego!
"Trump is simply opportunistic. Or as the old saying goes, now that Curiel is a good judge, the end justifies the means. <br/><br/>But I wonder, if pressed on his earlier statement of Judge Curiel as “very hostile,” “a very bad judge” and a “hater of Donald Trump,” and he “should be ashamed of himself. I think it’s a disgrace that he’s doing this.” if Trump would say - ""See, I was right. I chastised him and he didn't dare rule against me again.""? "
"I hope AG Jeff Sessions and other Trump appointees take note of how Judge Curiel operates.  This is how it is done.  You start by reading the Constitution and the laws pertinent to the case.  You review your oath of office and note that you do not owe personal loyalty to any individual, no matter how influential they are."
"I think you are missing something that has become clear to me as a practicing physician over 4 decades. Mr. Trump is a pathological liar and trying to understand his reasoning over what is right or wrong is impossible because he uncontrollably lies about so many things. He has no remorse about his lying and whether he says "" I will run into that school unarmed...like most of you in this room would too"" or that he is for gun reform more than his NRA fearing predecessor Obama--obvious lies to any reasonable person. He seems to forget that he has lied because he is always lying. Trying to understand a pathological liar is impossible except to understand because he is always lying."
"Public service and democratic ideals are truly alien to Trump. Ego and self agrandisement drive this man-child. His school yard taunts, his intolerance of racial and cultural diversity  and his misogynism are clear indicators of  his arrested development. We will vote this circus barker  out of office. "
"There is another little phrase that the good Judge has ""slyly"" noted in his opinion: That our elected officials ""can be thrown out of office"". <br/><br/>THROWN out.  Like trash."
"This Editorial rehashes the most pernicious aspects of Trump in the drivers seat. America’s Calamity Jane with burnt Cheerios winglets wrecks havoc wherever his finger does the talking in the twittersphere. <br/><br/>Acceptance of responsibility coupled with honesty, virtue and ethical norms are attributes best left to career politicians. "
It's always about Trump. Always. Every time. 
"Trump who was a never a man with a principle, proved it when he praised the same Judge Mr. Curiel yesterday and shown gratitude towards him saying ""U.S Judge sided with the Trump Administration"" as per your editorial.<br/><br/>And with his very short attention span due to a probable case of  A.D.D. he forgot or didn't care that this is the same judge whom he called  ""a Mexican"" just 2 years back not knowing then that the so called ""Mexican"" Judge was born in Indiana.<br/><br/>So with a man sitting in the White House supposedly still holding the nuclear button, it is totally mind boggling that a section of the Americans were stupid enough to hand over the reign of our country into the hands of a person who says 'White lies' at one moment and then forgets or denies it the next moment.<br/><br/>No wonder he fired his White House Communications Director Hope Hicks for telling the truth in a congressional hearing saying, ""My boss occasionally  required me to tell White lies for him.""  <br/><br/>So talking about Trump and all his subordinates' habits of telling 'White lies' in the White House, we've to presume that what our so called Chief Executive of this country said yesterday in a nationally televised get together with all the lawmakers that he'd go against his own Republican party and their paramour N.R.A. and implement universal background checks by himself, is nothing but a 'White lie"".<br/><br/>Yes, we've seen it before when Trump said one 'White lie' after another about the dreamers and for implementing D.A.C.A."
"I never cease to be amazed at the ignorance and lack of aqwareness among young reporters and the new editors and publishers of even the best newpapers!<br/>It is well known-apparently even among some of the other reportes at the Times, that DJT does not ""thumb"" his own messages. While I don't either, that's because I refuse to use such devices or applications. Mr. Trump, however, hires secretaries to be on call at all hours, to manage his message sending devices. If he actually did his own typing , he would have to spend much time learning to spell and , regardless of how well he has apparently learned to read; he has yet to learn to compose in the English language. That he actually puts text in himself is far above his skill set."
He has to have his way... every time.. even when he doesn’t know or understand what his way IS!  
"Judge Curiel should have let some other judge take this case - not that I doubt Curiel's judicial ability. <br/><br/>But the way a narcissistic sociopath like Donald Trump will see this, is that his bullying of Judge Curiel two years ago in the Trump University fraud case successfully made the judge subservient to him now in this case. <br/><br/>And the idea that bullying works is exactly the wrong message to send to Donald Trump, who already believes in winning through intimidation."
"When Trump says America first, what he actually means is Trump first."
"Bullying often works: it hurts the victim and preemptively silences others who hesitate to say what they think for fear of more bullying.<br/><br/>Clearly Judge Curiel was not cowed by Trump and did not allow his personal feelings get in the way of his judgment. I'm relieved that Judge Curiel cannot be fired by Trump or run out of office by Trump's followers. It gives credibility to his decision in this case. <br/><br/>By contrast, there are those whose careers and lives can be ruined by the accusations, excoriation and public humiliation caused by Trump's unhinged tweets. "
"I love the quote from Chief Justice John Roberts Jr;:<br/>It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices. !!!<br/>So people, next time you are called to vote, remember that quote."
This Judge would have made JFK's 'Profiles in Courage'.<br/>Kudos Jude Curiel.
"Trump does want to win. It is the only way to get things done. He will not lie down on the wall, other border security measures, and legal immigration policies that inappropriately favor relatives of those already here (sometimes illegally). Even a significant number of Times readers, who are mostly liberal, have no appetite for another round of amnesty without airtight borders and a re-vamped legal immigration policy. Where is the diversity when most of the legal and illegal immigrants come from Mexico and the Caribbean?"
"Trump stumps us again. It was just last year that he blasted this judge. The judge was labelled as Mexican and therefore couldn't be objective. Now, he applauds the same judge for his great decision on, of all things, a wall separating this country from Mexico. <br/><br/>I hate to be crude here, but is this guy playing with a full deck?"
"Has President Trump mastered 21st century communications more effectively than my favorite ""newspaper?""<br/><br/>How many Twitter followers does President Trump have?<br/><br/>How many subscribers (paper or electronic) does my favorite ""newspaper"" have?<br/><br/>Just sayin'"
"I don't think Trump cares so much about 'winning,"" as he does about getting away with it. As his numerous bankruptcies show, stiffing people he owes money to and coming out ahead is what gives him satisfaction. If he says one thing one day, then contradicts himself on another day, so what? He got away with it. He thinks of himself as above accountability, viz. his refusal to release his tax returns. See? He got away with it. He may call these episodes a ""big win."" But it's a cheap win. The ""win"" of a scoundrel."
"Where you write in conclusion:  ""That is what being a public servant in America sounds like, and it requires a level of selflessness and devotion to democratic ideals that are alien to Mr. Trump"" taken as true is itself enough to warrant his impeachment and removal.  Thank you, and stay the course!"
"It’s disturbing to read Trump characterizing Judge Curiel’s decision as a big win for the Trump Administration against a “U.S.Judge.” This makes it seem as though the judiciary and the Trump administration (the executive branch) are not co-equal branches of the same government, but rather adversaries in a bar room fight. Trump Aministration beats U. s. Judge. Maybe I am parsing this incorrectly, but I don’t think so. Trump interprets the real world through the distorted glasses of his malignant narcissistic ego. He has to go. "
"Criticizing President Trump for tweeting in his bathrobe?  Sad.<br/>This guy hardly sleeps at all (let alone with someone who's not<br/>Secret Service).  He's on the job 24/7, keeping us all (including YOU, NYTimes) informed about important stuff going on.  And he tells us whether the stuff is good stuff or bad stuff -- because sometimes it's tough to figure it out.  The Wall is a super idea to keep undocumented immigrants from fleeing to Mexico to escape the BEAUTIFUL Trump Police State.  Now we know. "
"When he said ""I'll love you"" in the meeting, there was never a better projection.  This man is craving, and desperately needs, to be adored.  <br/><br/>Just think, after PTSD (post-Trumpatic stress disorder), we'll have a Trump Presidential Library.  I guess that would be a TV playing FOX News, a smartphone and a Twitter account.  At least it will be small.  "
This is all so true yet Mr Trump seems to pay no price. 
"If the judiciary cannot protect us from the consequences of our political choices -- say by prosecuting a corrupt president whose narcissism, nepotism and shady business dealings have devolved into dereliction of duty or even treason by giving aid and comfort to our Russian enamies -- can or will a Republican-led Congress? Or will we be left with a choice between the Wall or a Big Military Parade or another Revolution?"
"If democracy means rule by the people, then we elect the President, the leader, of our country. And to me, that means, in a way, 'he is US'.<br/><br/>We have become the liar, the fraud, the greedy-boy-who-continues-to-cry-wolf. We are Trump. And those of us who didn't vote for him, we are guilty of not fighting hard enough for real democracy; including after Gore beats Bush by hundreds of thousands of votes but loses due to the undemocratic Electoral College (so, then, Hillary 'wins' by millions of votes, but 'loses'). Our bad. Very bad.<br/><br/>We are too politically lazy and uncommitted to be a democracy. As they say, the proof is in the pudding. Our pudding is billionaires and lobbyists and lawyers and bought politicians and judges. Our pudding is a grotesque concentration of wealth, income, property and power. Our pudding is poverty and slave wages and hedge fund landlords and much deeper sickness. Criminally incompetent democracy.<br/><br/>So, somehow, recharge, recommit, reconnect and fight for the good, for compassion, for equality: for a healthy democracy : the more perfect Union."
"This is no different than his pre-November 2016 screeching that the election ""is rigged!"" Then, when he won [the Electoral College vote] suddenly all is well and it wasn't rigged. It wasn't even rigged by the Russians. Believe me. "
"Frankly, I am slightly confused, not about the level of judicial behavior by Judge Curiel in that he represents by all he says the very model of a good federal judge in that he interprets the law, does not set policy. On the other hand, judges do set policy by their decisions, as in Citizens United, Brown v. BOE, Roe v. Wade, and how many other federal rulings. Indeed, those decision can be changed by another decision, but that process more laborious and we hope judged on legal merit, precedence. This ruling in my interpretation is in contrast to the Hawaiin judicial rulings on immigration. Yes, building a wall is not the same as immigration. Still, Judge Curiel has issued a ruling that may please Trump, but not others. Clarify, please, readers or NYT editorial board."
"more proof that the Twitiot sees everything in the light of how it impacts him personally and not what is good for US citizens, good for the country, good for the world , or good for humanity.   just what's good for him - and this is the opposite of leadership."
"While the NYT focuses on the tweets from America's thumbiest commander in chief, the Heritage Foundation focuses on the policies of the Trump Administration and has just announced:<br/>""With unprecedented speed, the Trump administration has already implemented nearly two-thirds of the 334 agenda items called for by the Heritage Foundation, a pace faster than former President Reagan who embraced the conservative think tank’s legendary “Mandate for Leadership” blueprint.""<br/><br/>When it comes to covering Trump the media is like a cat distracted by the laser pointer on the wall. Hint: Trump's tweets will not be the lasting legacy of this Administration, regardless of how much you write about them. "
"As Winston Churchill might have said of the Trump presidency: ""If the United States and its commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say 'This was NOT their finest hour'."""
